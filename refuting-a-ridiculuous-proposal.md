This is ridiculous on so many levels, the most obvious fault of this theory being the open question of
material removal. First you start with a square pit which is about h=146m deep with both sides a=230m long.
**That's h\*a\*a = 7,723,400m³ of material, three times the volume of the finished construction** since [V =
(h\*a\*a)/3](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramide_(Geometrie)#Geometrische_Eigenschaften) = 2,574,467m³
(roughly 2.5e6m³). Not only that, in order to finish the construction in the pit you have to first get rid
of almost 8e6m³ of rocks which you have to lift up for up to 150 meters of height difference, after which
you have to lower another 2.5e6m³ of pyramid building material into the hole.

Except of course for the material you want to cart in (or sledge in, throw in, or schlepp in, as the case
may be) to keep the construction site level. Since the fill material plus the pyramid has to fill the pit,
that means that first you dig out 8e6m³ of rock, then you fill back 8e6m³ of rock.

The way your concept works means when construction is 'almost' finished, you now have a 230m squared level
field but now the pyramid is inside with its tip just above the ground. So all that's left to do is to dig
out the fill material, roughly 8e6m³—2.5e6m³=5.5e6m³. At this point you will have moved
8e6m³+2.5e6m³+5.5e6m³=16e6m³ after which you still have to level the surrounding terrain because as far as I
know the Great Pyramid is not sitting in a deep hole, is it. This will add a few million cubic meters of
rocky meterial to move. We can't know how much because obviously it's gone now which is another problem but
OK. Let's be generous and say that around the pyramid there were eight squarish parcels of land about the
size of the pyramid at about the same height, so you will have to remove another 8 (eight!) pyramid pit
sized cubes of rock, each being around 8e6m³, so 8\*8e6m³=64e6m³ all told.

So yeah, **your plan means moving 16e6m³ for the pyramid proper plus maybe something around 64e6m³ to level
surrounding, which adds up to 16e6m³+64e6m³=80e6m³ of rocks which have to be moved. Of these, only 2.5e6m³
or 3% are for the pyramid proper, the rest (97%) is 'opportunity costs'**. That's devastating, to put it
charitably.

But where's the removed material now? There are pits in Giza, Tura and Aswan where they hauled the limestone
and granite to build the pyramid, but where are the 8e6m³+64e6m³ of rocks they needed to remove to first dig
the pit, then level the landscape? Seriously, where are those rocks?

Another minor problem is that right next to Khufu's pyramid there's Khafre's pyramid. Assuming they build
that one according to your plan as well, that would mean that for some time the Great Pyramid of Gizah must
have stood right next to a steep vertical cliff ~150m high since Khufu's pyramid is only like 300m away.
