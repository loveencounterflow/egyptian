Instead of an answer, I will broadly outline what I think might be a plausible procedure to build a pyramid for your pharaoh.

First, the Egyptians were of course aware that they could build pyramids and other monumental structures out of a number of materials, which they selected carefully (viz. the quartzite sand found behind the walls of the QC's passage way, which although being 'just sand' was never the less not sourced locally). They knew what it would take, how many people and how many years it would take to finish such a project. I only say this because some people, myself included, at first look at a monument like the Great Pyramid and wonder how anyone could've planned and accomplish such a massive structure while forgetting that there are thousands of impossibly huge stone monuments both over and under the ground in Egypt, each of which by far surpasses what peeps like you and I could or would want to manage in a life time with little else than pounding stone on stone. We can be sure the Egyptians were great planners and routine builders; as such, one should always expect a given detail to be the result of purposeful foresight instead of negligence, so the fact that the Queen's Chamber's shafts were sealed on both ends is also probably the result of careful planning rather than a late realization of "oh shucks we don't need those after all, let's just seal those shafts and move on".

The Egyptians also knew they could hit one of a number of snags during construction. For one thing, the added mass of huge piles of stone could lead to subsistence; for another, the grave's owner could die before the grave was finished. Come to think of it, the sheer number of unfinished graves leads me to think that not only being buried before a grave is finished was quite common—it might also be the case that you were expected to (pay for) work on your burial site for as long as you lived, and once you were dead, your successor would then take care of swiftly wrapping up works, organize a proper burial and then start their own decade-long project (and going on to pay workers who had sort-of lifetime jobs). So maybe getting finished with a grave was not the central idea; rather, as long as you live there's *always* going to be another wall that you could decorate, another feature to be added. For the grace of getting old you also had the obligation of continually improving your burial site (and paying workers for another year of chiseling and painting).

As for the pyramids, my favorite theory is that they not only *evolved* from step pyramids (which, in turn, evolved from single-step mastabas)—they literally *incorporated* them. This makes sense for planning, the actual construction, and the statics of the building. The pyramid of Meidum shows this clearly, and so do some of the satellite pyramids of Giza. 

As for the Great Pyramid, I believe the course of events may have been: 

**1)** Excavate the (or re-use an existing) Descending Passage and Subterranean Chamber. This could be just taking over an existing structure of a site on the Giza plateau which we now believe to have been in use for settlement and burial for quite a while at the time the pyramids were erected. The S. C. could have served as a resting place for pharaoh in the event he were to die early on; maybe its purpose was just for exploration to see whether the rock went deep enough and had no major fissures.

**2)** Erect a mastaba directly on top of the Subterranean Chamber. Such a mastaba would have been pierced on its top by the Well Shaft through which the Subterranean Chamber could be accessed as is the case with other mastaba burials.

**3)** Erect the next step of the mastaba and constructing the Queen's Chamber in its center. The floor of the Horizontal Passageway would presumably be the roof of the first mastaba if the model holds. When the second step is finished, the Queen's Chamber would be roofed by a few meters of material and ready to receive pharaoh's mummy should it become necessary. Room had to be left for the lower part of the Grand Gallery which would have to be filled in that event.

**4)** Start the third step of the mastaba on top of the second; this one would incorporate the Grand Gallery and the King's Chamber for which room must be left. **After this has been finished, we have a three-stepped mastaba, the outermost layers of which are (at least near the top) made from fine Tura limestone and have tiny but covered openings for the Queen's Chamber's air shafts**. This would neatly explain why the Q.C.'s air shafts were originally concealed, covered at their tops with lids, and lined with fine Tura limestone near their upper ends: they were not open because they were only to be used as a contingency, and the white limestone was placed there because it would constitute the outer walls of the monument in case the pyramid could not be finished.

**5)** Now, finish the owl :-) by placing a fourth step on top; then, fill the steps with rougher and, towards the outside, finer backing blocks (which is what we see today); finally, cover the building in casing stones.

I've omitted the Great Void so far but let me say we have a fair chance that it does exist, simply because the presumably much smaller North Face Corridor was also found based on the results of the ScanPyramid project. Its role in the construction of the pyramid would, in my imagination at least, be quite similar to that of the Grand Gallery, namely provide an ascent passage for the huge granite blocks needed for the King's Chamber and the Relieving Chambers. The step-by-step order of construction paired with gashes in the steps could have been used to ensure that at any given time work could proceed on a level floor with the material being either moved up a ramp (Grand Gallery and Great Void), across level floor, and then hoisted up or lowered down by some amount to be placed into the intended position. At almost any given time, the existing structure could be finished in rather short order, to serve as underground burial, a mastaba, a stepped pyramid or a true pyramid, as the case may be.
