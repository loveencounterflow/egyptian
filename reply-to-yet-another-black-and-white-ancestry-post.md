> most of Europe is descended from Charlemagne

so this is typical of the kind of pamphlets that people like you—people on a mission to defy current
scientific understanding of a topic—are prone to write. It's a complete strawman. Who in their right mind is
claiming that "most of Europe is descended from Charlemagne"? Nobody in their right mind does, that's who's
claiming that kind of stuff, only "people on a mission to defy reason".

Another thing that "people on a mission" regularly get hooked up on is a black-and-white painting of reality
that only allows bipolar assessments, it's always either "no genetic connection, totally separate
populations" like Egypt is another planet (your assertion what modern science allegedly does) or else it's
"we're direct descendants of Egypt (or Charlemagne, or Jesus, whatever), it's our heritage". Also a strong
systematic predeliction for genealogy as if there was no way to learn another language or cultural
techniques without that leaving traces in the DNA.

Ancient Egypt is, like many (most? all?) cultural centers / regions (beyond a certain small size),
essentially a confluence of diverse people, languages, technologies, practices, religions; as time passes,
an identity may be born in that cradle, and a conscious perception of 'otherness' as opposed to people not
within that context will arise concomittantly, once the identity has attained some prevalence. This is how
you get the many, many pharaonic inscriptions that praise the ruler for "smiting" their enemies, for keeping
them from crossing the boundaries and so on. So in a way, what you claim modern scientists are engaging in,
the Pharohs of old wrote about themselves: "we're the ones, the others are just the others, and that's not
us".

Other than that, Ancient Egypt also had a rather cosmopolitan face, and one can guess with confidence that
the people in the street provided a rather more colorful picture than what the highly idealized, stylized
and conventionalized imagery of the murals of noble sepulchures would have you think (one has always to
remember that with Egyptian art, the more official the occasion, the more 'iconic' the imagery got; in the
words of one Egyptologist, they are "Darstellungen"—"this indicates a throne, that indicates a granary"—not
"Abbildungen"—this is what this actual throne, that particular granary look like").

As is the case today, people will immigrate and emigrate, they will attain and lose status, they will teach
foreign things within the country and domestic things when abroad.

But yeah when you're on a mission then of course "most of Europe is descended from Charlemagne", period.
