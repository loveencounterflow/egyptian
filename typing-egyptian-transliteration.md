## *Espanso* Encoding Scheme

* There's a multitude of transliteration schemes for Ancient Egyptian (AE)
* often these differ only in details
* the differences are mostly (but not only) present in the correspondences between AE monoliterals and the
  chosen Latin letter(s)
* it seems advantageous to adopt a schema where we can go from commonly accessible Latin letters to
  *multiple* transliteration schemes, including the (Brugsch-like???????????????????????????) AE
  monoliterals themselves
* probably best to adopt the well-established, ASCII-only Manuel de Codage transliteration as Base
  Transliteration (BT)
* multiple 'transliteration targets' (TTs) (Leiden, Gardiner, Brugsch &c) can be differentiated by prefixes
* the same BT can be used in tag-based markup languages; e.g. one could encode Thutmosis III's throne name
  (Menkheperre) in BT as `mn,xpr,ra` and display in *AE* *m*ono*l*iterals by way of a markup like
  `<aeml>mn,xpr,ra</aeml>`
