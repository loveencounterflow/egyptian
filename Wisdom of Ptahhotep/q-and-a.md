Accademia dâ€™Egitto (Egypt academy) in Rome. Does it say anything? I see many repeating patterns.

```
m aA ib=k Hr rx=k
em a'a ibek her rekhek
Do not be proud because of your education,

nDnD r=k Hna xm mi rx
nedjnedj rek hena khem mi rekh
but discuss with the ignorant as you would with the learned.
```

From that old classic, the Wisdom of Ptahhotep. I translated a bunch of it at the end of my first semester
and now as soon as I saw nDnD I recognized it.
