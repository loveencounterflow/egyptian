I believe this question can be reasonably answered—or rather discussed—outside of any pseudo-scientific or
incivility. If you allow me to quote myself from a recent answer of mine:

My view is that the skin colors are intended to typify people, things, and animals; you often see reed mats
laid out with green color which indicates what material the reed mat was made from. Most actual reed mats
were certainly not green, except (perhaps) when freshly woven. Actual Egyptian farm hands did almost
certainly not look as uniform and did not spend their working days as neatly lined up; the actual horses
drawing Thutmosis III's chariot into the battle field were certainly not moving their limbs in as exacting a
synchronous fashion as commonly depicted, nor did Pharaoh both steer the chariot and shoot arrows at the
same time. 

It's all an idealized and typified view, more Mario-the-plumber decals than pictures of actual plumbers. On
the other hand we have lots and lots of examples where otherwise mysterious abstract lines like the *stp* of
*stp-n Ra'* 'chosen of Ra' have become identifiable through archeological finds, in this case the adze (a
tool in woodworking); this tells us that while typified the imagery is founded in visual appearance (with a
generous dash when it comes to the imaginary appearance of deities, but then even those have real-world
emanations like falcons and the sun disk). It's not like the Egyptians painted the human body in green,
blue, yellow, red to symbolize cardinal direction of their homelands or something, though they did something
similar with depictions of deities.

Based on these observations, I'd venture to claim that the Ancient Egyptian renderings of human skin tones
are similar to modern characterizations (brown, black, white, yellow, red)—categorical, yes, but not purely
symbolic (as in, "he was green with envy"). This is also supported by modern distributions of skin tones
which in my impression seem to align rather well with those depicted by the ancient artists.
