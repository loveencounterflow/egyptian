* Q: Golden writings on the ancient walls. Whats the most interesting thing about hieroglyphs?

  * A1 (by someone): The most interesting thing is that each symbol does have a sound. How they are arranged
    or read: from top to bottom, right to left, left to right, may have a different sound or meaning. The
    Egyptians were very good at writing spells, and some could only read in one direction, whereas a priest or
    scribe could read in every direction. Bob Brier would probably be able to elaborate on the subject more
    than I though.

    * A2 (by me): Yes, correct, but only when you read the text in the modern strict sense. Other than that, I'm
      sure Egyptians that were well-versed in their native culture but not necessarily fully literate or only
      partially or passively so could recognize and name potentially any sign, including—and that is the key
      point—not only the determinatives of the text proper, but also those elements that we would declare are
      pictorial in a given piece of art. Although in later times the functions of text and picture are clearly
      separate, it is still the case that e.g. the baboons depicted in Tutankhamun's burial chamber serve both
      as depictions of the baboons as well as the determinatives of the names that are phonetically spelled out
      above their heads. Also, given the rather persistent and static nature of many art motives over millenia
      such as the "pharaoh in the 'Orion-pose', smiting the enemy" ('Orion-pose' is my term, I found it
      somewhere and I find it makes sense), one can imagine there were commonplace meaningful vocalizations that
      relied on these pictures being just as conventionalized as the hieroglyphs proper, only drawn in a rather
      more detailed and varied way. Observe that the same 'Orion-pose' is also found in at least one instance
      depicting the deceased doing bird-hunting; you see some captured birds in his left (right) hand instead of
      an enemy, and instead of a mace, he's holding a throwing-stick in his right hand (in the left part of the
      picture). One could surmise that the Egyptians had a specific word for exactly this depiction of a
      posture, to the degree that the abstract posture was tantamount to spelling the word out, for the audience
      later to be read out loud—pictures acting as readable writing, kind of as a not-yet-fully-developed
      script.

      * A3: True. This manifests in a device known as Amphiboly- where a pictoral scene can be read in
        multiple ways- one visual, one semantic. It is discussed in a case study in this paper:
        https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.1086/677251.pdf

        Intention of amphiboly in these cases is near impossible to prove, but amphiboly can be picked up
        almost anywhere of you look hard enough. It also appears in the increasing ideogrammification (a
        word of my own coining lol) of the language moving into the late period and beyond. The process
        began in the Cryptographic writings of the new Kingdom, where hieroglyphs could become fully-fledged
        pictograms spelling out a specific sentence by mere depiction. To play to your example, the image of
        a king in the 'orion-pose' smiting a foreigner in the cryptographic titulary of Seti I spelled out
        the phrase dr psḏt pḏwt 'who subdues the Nine Bows', part of his Nebty name. The intention behind
        these scenes can be proven, unlike pictoral scenes, by the presence of parallel texts. But this
        applies only to very specific cryptographic compositions and not to 'normalschrift', or 'regular'
        hieroglyphic writing. As we move into the Ptolemaic period though, signs which used to act as mere
        determinatives receive more ideogrammatic values, i.e. they are able to stand alone as words with
        both phonetic and semantic value.
