## Rules


* each consonant / element from the hieroglyphic orthography must be accounted for
* we assume that all signs of the conventional set of uniliterals represent consonants in the sense that
  none of the uniliterals can appear as the nucleus of FEP
* we assume that the conventional set of uniliterals is sufficient (and somewhat redundant) to represent the
  consonants of a certain (fictional) stage of the Egyptian language
  * there are some consonants that are represented by multiple uniliterals, but there are no consonants that
    are not represented by at least one uniliteral
* the opposition of 𓋴 *s* vs 𓊃 *z* is somewhat of a special case as these two uniliterals are used without
  distinction for the same words by the 18th / 19th dynasties; it is therefore difficult to decide what the
  correct form for the name of Ramesses should be: is it 𓂋𓅓𓋴𓋴 or 𓂋𓅓𓊃𓊃? Both forms do appear in the written
  record
* the names of the uniliteral signs take the form VCV (unlike any other words in FEP); the C represents the
  uniliteral in question and V the uniliteral's 'inherent' vowel; most consonants have a /e/ as inherent
  vowel but some have /a/ and some have /o/:

  ```
  A 𓄿 /aꜣa/
  i 𓇋 /aya/
  y 𓏭 /aya/
  Y 𓇌 /aya/
  a 𓂝 /aꜥa/
  w 𓅱 /awa/
  b 𓃀 /ebe/
  p 𓊪 /epe/
  f 𓆑 /efe/
  m 𓅓 /eme/
  n 𓈖 /ene/
  r 𓂋 /ere/
  h 𓉔 /ehe/
  H 𓎛 /oḥo/
  x 𓐍 /eḫe/
  X 𓄡 /eẖe/
  z 𓊃 /eze/
  s 𓋴 /ese/
  S 𓈙 /eše/
  q 𓈎 /oqo/
  k 𓎡 /eke/
  g 𓎼 /ege/
  t 𓏏 /ete/
  T 𓍿 /eṯe/
  d 𓂧 /ede/
  D 𓆓 /eḏe/
  ```

* Of the inherent vowels, /e/ is called 'weak' and the other two, /a/ and /o/, 'strong'

* To vocalize a monoliteral word:
  * If it is a function word or affix (including clitics) like *s-*, *-m*, *-n*, *-r*, *-f*, use the
    traditional Egyptological readings /se-/, /-em/, /-en/, /-er/, /-ef/; *-w* and *-y* are vocalized as
    /-aw/ and /-aj/, respectively
  * If it is, on the other hand, a content word such as a noun, verb or adjective, append a long vowel /a/
    to the sole consonant, as in *t* 'bread' which is vocalized as /ta/ [taː].—This rule may look somewhat
    arbitrary but there are some motivations behind it:
    * frequent default vowel
    * most open vowel, most un-consonantal sound, yet also associated with a unique
      (negatively-constrictive) gesture; /a/ is paradoxically 'close to consonants' in the sense that
      producing and perceiving a glottal stop in front of a vowel is easier with /ꜣa/ than with, say, /ꜣi/
    * across languages, consonant elision is frequently associated with a lengthened vowel; this may be
      understood as a process where the (relatively difficult) movement to produce a constriction in a VC
      syllable is simplified by just continuing the vowel without changing the 'timing slots' of the word,
      which results in VV, a lengthened vowel (or a diphthong as the case may be)
    * Using a strong and long vowel helps uniliteral words to stand their ground in the stream of mostly
      longer and more substantial content words

* To vocalize a pluriliteral word, take the transcribed string of consonants and, for every space between
  two consonants:
  * if the inherent vowel of both consonants is the same, insert that vowel (ex.: *sd* /sed/, *ḥq* /ḥoq/,
    *ı͗w* /jaw/)
  * if one of the inherent vowels is weak (/e/) and the other is strong (/a/, /o/), insert the strong one
    (ex.: *sq* /soq/, *qs* /qos/)
  * if both vowels are strong ones, insert the one that belongs to the *following* consonant (ex.: *ḥqꜣ*
    /ḥoqaꜣ/ not \*/ḥoqoꜣ/, *ḏḥwtj* /ḏoḥawataj/)

𓋾𓉺𓇗

𓇗𓂝𓊖 'Upper Egyptian'.

Words, city names, and deity names are often abbreviated in the names of people. The word in the cartouche
heqa 𓋾 is an abbreviation of the usual spelling, 𓋾𓈎 'ruler', the word here iunu 𓉺 is an abbreviation of the
city name 𓉺𓏌𓊖 'Heliopolis' (more on that in a bit), and the word shemau 𓇗 is an abbreviation of 𓇗𓂝𓊖 'Upper
Egyptian'.

The name Heliopolis was given to the city by the Greeks because it was a cult center of the Sun god (hence
Helios + Polis = Heliopolis, 'city of the sun'). But in ancient times, it was called iwnw or Iunu meaning
'The Pillars'.

Upper Egypt (Arabic: صعيد مصر Ṣaʿīd Miṣr, shortened to الصعيد, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation:
[es.sˤe.ˈʕiːd], locally: [es.sˤɑ.ˈʕiːd]; Coptic: ⲙⲁⲣⲏⲥ, romanized: Mares) is the southern portion of Egypt
and is composed of the Nile River valley south of the delta and the 30th parallel N. It thus consists of the
entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser (formed by the Aswan High Dam). [2]

In ancient Egypt, Upper Egypt was known as tꜣ šmꜣw,[3] literally "the Land of Reeds" or "the Sedgeland".[4]
It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their
rival city states during the Naqada III period (c. 3200–3000 BC), and its subsequent unification with Lower
Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period.[5] Upper and Lower Egypt became intertwined in the symbolism of
pharaonic sovereignty such as the Pschent double crown.[6] Upper Egypt remained as a historical region even
after the classical period.

a word is long, supporting our proposal to put stress on the first syllable of a word

### Rilly

[*The Decipherment of Meroitic | Claude Rilly, Sorbonne* by The Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures
(ISAC, @ISAC_UChicago)](https://youtu.be/Myj8ehkVRw8?t=1806), transcript from 30:42:

> Egyptian *nbw* (reads [ne'bu]), pronounced [na'bau]

As for the question whether 'gold' should be transcribed as *nbw* or *nwb*, see [Francis Breyer, *,Nubien‘
und äg. nb.w ,Gold‘ – eine Gegendarstellung*, in MittSAG 20
p173ff](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/mittsag/article/download/85552/79931) (cf. also
[*Der Antike Sudan. Mitteilungen der Sudanarchäologischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin e.
V.*](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/mittsag])), who states unambiguously that reading
\*/nub/ is an anachronistic (late) Coptic reading that somehow made it into parts of the egyptological
tradition; he quotes Beni Hassan I, 8:11 as rendering a complete writing of Gardiner S12 with all
consonants, n-S12-b-w<sup>Z3</sup> (wheras the more frequently written S12-w *could* conceivably be
reconstructed as *nwb*). This fully confirms the above reading of C. Rilly.

## Name of Akhenaten

(Wikipedia *Akhenaten*)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten]:

> Akhenaten (pronounced /ˌækəˈnɑːtən/), also spelled Akhenaton or Echnaton (Ancient Egyptian: ꜣḫ-n-jtn
> ʾŪḫə-nə-yātəy, pronounced [ˈʔuːχəʔ nə ˈjaːtəj], meaning 'Effective for the Aten')

Quoted after:

* Loprieno, Antonio (1995) *Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction*, Cambridge: Cambridge University
  Press

* Loprieno, Antonio (2001) "From Ancient Egyptian to Coptic" in Haspelmath, Martin et al. (eds.), *Language
  Typology and Language Universals*

Here 'Aten' as last part of a name is reconstructed as [ˈjaːtəj], likely with a high vowel plus an
already elided [n] \(as opposed to the [n] having become a high vowel); compare to our proposal ['jaten].

## Meaning of the name Aten

> The word Aten appears in the Old Kingdom as a noun meaning "disc" which referred to anything flat and
> circular; the sun was called the "disc of the day" where Ra was thought to reside.[3] By analogy, the term
> "silver aten" was sometimes used to refer to the moon.[4] High relief and low relief illustrations of the
> Aten show it with a curved surface, therefore, the late scholar Hugh Nibley insisted that a more correct
> translation would be globe, orb or sphere, rather than disk.—https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten

> griech. Patoumos < äg. Pr.w-\*'Ia:tā́m.uw (Ortsname)


## Khwfw

Our rules would render Cheop's name Khwfw as 'Khawafu' which is surely not desirable, or is it? [Wikipedia
quotes [Gundacker 2015]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu)

> While modern Egyptological pronunciation renders his name as Khufu, at the time of his reign his name was
> probably pronounced as Kha(w)yafwi(y), and during the Hellenized era, Khewaf(w).
>
> **Footnote:** Gundacker, Roman (2015) “The Chronology of the Third and Fourth Dynasties according to
> Manetho’s Aegyptiaca” in *Towards a New History for the Egyptian Old Kingdom*, page 114–115, provides the
> final vowel but disagrees with Loprieno in some details of the word’s subsequent development: where
> Loprieno considers the semivowels preceding the tonic /a/ to have ultimately reduced to glottal stops,
> Gundacker posits that /j/ assimilated to the preceding /w/, which was preserved.

This then lends further motivation to our suggestion to read initial and medial w as '(a)wa'.

## Iwnw (Ἡλιούπολις)

As with Khufu -> Khawafu, we should render Iwnw not as Iunu, but as Iawanu; this indeed seems [close to
serious reconstructions (as opposed to our purely conventional 'spelling
pronunciation')]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)#Names:

> Its native name was iwnw ("The Pillars"), whose exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian
> recorded only consonantal values. Arabic : Iwan إيوان. [5]
>
> Its traditional Egyptological transcription is Iunu but it appears in biblical Hebrew as ʾŌn (אֹן‎,[6]
> אוֹן‎[7]), and ʾĀwen (אָוֶן‎[8]). Some scholars to reconstruct its pronunciation in earlier Egyptian as
> \*ʔa:wnu, perhaps from older /ja:wunaw/. Variant transcriptions include Awnu and Annu. The name survived as
> Coptic ⲱⲛ ŌN.[9]

## Nswt


Instead of [nesut], we'd read nswt as [nesawat], and [indeed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nswt):

> * (reconstructed) IPA(key): /nijˈsiːwat/ → /nijˈsiːjaʔ/ → /ʔənˈsiːʔə/ → /ʔənˈsiːʔ/
> * (modern Egyptological) IPA(key): /nɛsuːt/

In fact, our [nesawat] is somewhat closer to the reconstructed pronunciation than the traditional
Egyptological reading.

## Unas / Wnjs

(Reddit
user Ankhu_pn)[https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientEgyptian/comments/15dscwp/comment/ju6mkib/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
shared the following reconstruction of Unas's name: "Are you sure that /nibmuʕaʔˈɾiːʕə/ is more convenient
than 'Nebmaatre'? Or /wanniju-suwa/ instead of 'Unas'?". Not sure where the last part /suwa/ comes in, but
at least for the onset he gives /wan/, so another hint in favor of the present proposal, which would turn wnjs into /wanaias/.

## Tut-Ankh-Amon

* Book by Theodore M. Davis is entitled [*The tombs of Harmhabi and
  Touatânkhamanou*](https://archive.org/details/theodoremdavisex0000davi/page/n3/mode/2up), i.e. the author
  read *twt* not as \*/tut/ (traditional Egyptological pronunciation) and not as \*/tawat/ (our proposal),
  but in a 'midway' fashion, as it were, as /tuwat/. The use of *ou* seems to indicate a monophthongue as
  does the *ou* in his *amanou*, i.e. French orthographical influence.

## Sesh Kemet

## Stress and Epenthetic (Euphonic) Vowels

We propose to

* always put the stress on the *first* root syllable of each word
* after any proclitics like *se-* (causative)
* re-syllabify words such that `CV.CV.CVC` (where each `V`owel is preceded, and at the end followed, by a
  `C`onsonant) is preferred over, say, `CVC.VC.VC`.
* If we assume a rule that in ancient Egyptian regular words (except things like some grammatical particles
  like `m` (`/em/`), names of letters (`/eme/`, `/aʔa/`), interjections, foreign names &c.) a vowel must
  always be 'guarded' by consonants before and after it, it follows that one should think of the `/f/` of
  `/nefer/` as *ambisyllabic*, that is, belonging to both the first and the second syllable; this assumption
  is quite natural, simple, and independent of the question whether there are / should be geminated
  consonants like the two `s` in Ramesses, `/raꜥmesesaw/` -> `/raꜥmessaw/` == `/raꜥmes:aw/` (i.e. the
  lengthened `/s:/` is ambisyllabic)

This means that `nfr` becomes `/ne'fer/`, which has stress on the second syllable, and that in `nfrw`, the
stress stays on the second syllable: `/ne'fe.raw/` == `[nɛ'fɛrɔw]` because `/-w/` is enclitic.

Further,

* in noun-adjective compounds such as `pr-ꜥʔ` ('house', 'great'), the noun is the stressed part; this gives
  `/'per-ꜥaʔ/` ('big house') with stress on the first syllable;
* where sequences of words have become lexicalized, epenthetic (euphonic) vowels are added between the last
  consonant of the preceding and the first consonant of the succeeding part; this then gives `/'peraꜥaʔ/` ==
  `['pɛrɒʕæʔ]`, which is quite close to Φαραώ

> **maybe** should make the first vowel of a word *a*, the other ones the inherent vowel *e*/*o*

> **maybe** should make the only vowel of monosyllabic words a long *a*, as in *ta* 'bread'
