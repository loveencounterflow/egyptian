𓋾𓉺𓇗

𓇗𓂝𓊖 'Upper Egyptian'.

Words, city names, and deity names are often abbreviated in the names of people. The word in the cartouche
heqa 𓋾 is an abbreviation of the usual spelling, 𓋾𓈎 'ruler', the word here iunu 𓉺 is an abbreviation of the
city name 𓉺𓏌𓊖 'Heliopolis' (more on that in a bit), and the word shemau 𓇗 is an abbreviation of 𓇗𓂝𓊖 'Upper
Egyptian'.

The name Heliopolis was given to the city by the Greeks because it was a cult center of the Sun god (hence
Helios + Polis = Heliopolis, 'city of the sun'). But in ancient times, it was called iwnw or Iunu meaning
'The Pillars'.

Upper Egypt (Arabic: صعيد مصر Ṣaʿīd Miṣr, shortened to الصعيد, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation:
[es.sˤe.ˈʕiːd], locally: [es.sˤɑ.ˈʕiːd]; Coptic: ⲙⲁⲣⲏⲥ, romanized: Mares) is the southern portion of Egypt
and is composed of the Nile River valley south of the delta and the 30th parallel N. It thus consists of the
entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser (formed by the Aswan High Dam). [2]

In ancient Egypt, Upper Egypt was known as tꜣ šmꜣw,[3] literally "the Land of Reeds" or "the Sedgeland".[4]
It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their
rival city states during the Naqada III period (c. 3200–3000 BC), and its subsequent unification with Lower
Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period.[5] Upper and Lower Egypt became intertwined in the symbolism of
pharaonic sovereignty such as the Pschent double crown.[6] Upper Egypt remained as a historical region even
after the classical period.

## Reading of initial *j* as [ja]

* https://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/aten.htm mentions

> his name would be more correctly pronounced, "Yati(n)"

although the author does not give any further reasons.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten

> Aten also Aton, Atonu, or Itn (Ancient Egyptian: jtn, reconstructed [ˈjaːtin])

* Wilson, Hilary *Hieroglyphen lesen*, dtv 2000, p192:

> Ah-mose, [...] [der] alte[...] Mondgott[...] Iah, des Mondes in seiner physischen Gestalt

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iah:

> Iah (Egyptian: jꜥḥ, Coptic ⲟⲟϩ) is a lunar deity in ancient Egyptian religion. The word jꜥḥ simply means
> "Moon". It is also transcribed as Yah, Jah, or Aah.

* *Ancient Egyptian Phonology* p146

> The spellings with three reed-leaves suggest /aj/ ( over ) and /ja/ (█ over █), indicating that the word

> “oh” (particle: 475.1, 476.4 ). These two words are undoubtedly related, and most likely represent /ja/.

## Meaning of the name Aten

[*The Bivalence of Coptic Eta and Related Problems in the Vocalization of Egyptian* by Thomas O. Lambdin](https://copticsounds.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/the-bivalence-of-coptic-eta-and-related-problems-in-the-vocalization-of-egyptian.pdf), *Journal of Near Eastern Studies*, Vol. 17, No. 3 (July, 1958), pp. 177-193; published by The University of Chicago Press, Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/542885

p187 (pdf p12):

> names *Mi-in-pa-aḫ-ta-ri-a*, *Mnpḥty-Rꜥ*, "Reꜥ is enduring of power,"

This would lead one to believe that initial *w-* to be read as {wa-} and at least some medial, final *w* as
{-awa}.

## Khwfw

Our rules would render Cheop's name Khwfw as 'Khawafu' which is curely not desirable, or is it? [Wikipedia
quotes [Gundacker 2015]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu)

> While modern Egyptological pronunciation renders his name as Khufu, at the time of his reign his name was
> probably pronounced as Kha(w)yafwi(y), and during the Hellenized era, Khewaf(w).
>
> **Footnote:** Gundacker, Roman (2015) “The Chronology of the Third and Fourth Dynasties according to
> Manetho’s Aegyptiaca” in *Towards a New History for the Egyptian Old Kingdom*, page 114–115, provides the
> final vowel but disagrees with Loprieno in some details of the word’s subsequent development: where
> Loprieno considers the semivowels preceding the tonic /a/ to have ultimately reduced to glottal stops,
> Gundacker posits that /j/ assimilated to the preceding /w/, which was preserved.

This then lends further motivation to our suggestion to read initial and medial w as '(a)wa'.

## Iwnw (Ἡλιούπολις)

As with Khufu -> Khawafu, we should render Iwnw not as Iunu, but as Iawanu; this indeed seems [close to
serious reconstructions (as opposed to our purely conventional 'spelling
pronunciation')]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)#Names:

> Its native name was iwnw ("The Pillars"), whose exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian
> recorded only consonantal values. Arabic : Iwan إيوان. [5]
>
> Its traditional Egyptological transcription is Iunu but it appears in biblical Hebrew as ʾŌn (אֹן‎,[6]
> אוֹן‎[7]), and ʾĀwen (אָוֶן‎[8]). Some scholars to reconstruct its pronunciation in earlier Egyptian as
> \*ʔa:wnu, perhaps from older /ja:wunaw/. Variant transcriptions include Awnu and Annu. The name survived as
> Coptic ⲱⲛ ŌN.[9]
